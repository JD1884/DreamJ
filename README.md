# DreamJ1
DJ - software

Use the shortcut in the home folder to run the latest x64 build. 

Some features, the rest is to discover by yourself:
	* DreamJ will save your settings, check out "C:\ProgramData\vJD\DreamJ\DreamJSetup.xml".
	* Pitch and speed of a track can be manipulated by the two faders at the left of the faders.
			The first fader represents the speed of the track, the second one for the pitch.
			When you want to change the speed but want to keep the pitch the same, you need to compansate with the second fader.
			This will happens automatically when your key lock is on.
